Because we can't include a default email account (w/ password), the only way to
get dev emails to work "out of the box" is to use the file (or console) backend.
This basically "sends" emails to log files in the django_project/@ emails/ directory.

More info:
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/topics/email/#email-backends

If you want to add your own email account, see local_example.py
