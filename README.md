## Installation

The project requires Python 3.8 or higher along with a few packages as described in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt). To install these packages, it is recommended that you first create a virtual environment using a tool such as `venv`. To install the packages listed in requirements.txt, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

The website also uses jQuery, Popper.js, Bootstrap, and Font Awesome but they are not hosted locally, instead they are hot-linked from a few CDNs and no installation is required.

The development web server is ran using the command `python manage.py runserver`.

Our developer documentation can be found [here](docs).
