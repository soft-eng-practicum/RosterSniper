## Installation

The project requires Python 3.8 or higher along with a few packages as described in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt). To install these packages, it is recommended that you first create a virtual environment using a tool such as `venv`. To install the packages listed in requirements.txt, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

The website also uses jQuery, Popper.js, Bootstrap, and Font Awesome, but they are not hosted locally, instead they are hot-linked from a few CDNs and no installation is required.

The development web server is run using the command `python manage.py runserver`.

Our developer documentation can be found [here](docs) and a list of contributors can be found [here](Contributors.md).

# Fall-2022 (Team "Three Musketeers+1")

As a part of our Software Development II course with Dr. Anca, our team has been working on developing a web application called RosterSniper. This application has been worked on by previous developers and our team has updated some bugs and added some new features. Now, in addition to allowing students to watch a class, get notified when a spot opens up for the class, and find empty classrooms, students can now choose to opt out of push notifications and they now have the chance to use a 24-hr time format and input specific times when looking for classes. They can also collapse and expand course tabs after searching so that only the classes they are interested in take up space on their screens.

## List of working features
Add a short summary for each item. 1-2 statements describing it.

## If you are a DEVELOPER:

The project requires Python 3.8 or higher along with a few packages as described in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt). To install these packages, it is recommended that you first create a virtual environment using a tool such as `venv`. To install the packages listed in requirements.txt, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Once you have a venv created, please read [this](/Docs-Fall2022/TM_DevSetup.md) to have a quick rundown on how to setup and run a development environment.

## If you are a USER:

To run the web application, simply go to the rostersniper.com website. If you have NoScript - or any other security browser plugins that disable scripts - please ensure it is disabled, or has RosterSniper whitelisted.
